// create a functional component for listing indevidual video item to the component Video LIst
//console.log(props); that is props = {videoitem: {â€¦}}. because we pass a prop videoitem in the parent component VideoList and inside the child component VideoItem so we can destructure with parameter with an that array  ({videoitem})
const VideoItem = ({videoitem,onVideoSelect}) => {
    return (
    // pass an event onClick with the nested callback onVideoSelec with argument videoitem - which we were created at App.js and passed both App and VideoList as well. 
    <div onClick={() => onVideoSelect(videoitem)} 
    
    // basically when we are communicating from a parent down to child we can do that very easy with the prop system, but anytime that we want to communicate from a child's back to some parent component we usually make use of a callback which is exactly what we did in this component by creating a nested call back function.
